<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Joyna Rout, a B.Tech student in KIIT. I don't know why but I'm always unsuccesful to stop myself from explaining 
  how I ended up in KIIT. So, let's begin that un-hide-able story in brief.</p> 

<p>Actually I had a very good score that is 96% in 10h grade for which my teachers made me believe that I have a good 
  career in medical field so I was admitted to Aakash for coaching. I was unfortunate enough to fall in COVID-19 traps
  and lose my hardworking skills through online classes. So, basically I couldn't prove myself in my 11th grade. I got
  a little serious in the next stage and just gave my best. Though I didn't achieve my desired results but 12th boards
  was something -10 of the last boards that is 86%. Ni, this wasn't enough ! The same year my NEET score too couldn't
  help me with making my mom happy.</p>

<p>After a lot of chaos in my mind I decided to take a drop and study again, fight again for my life. I said to myself
  that this is a do or die situation for me. If I don't make it this time then I gonna end myself since it was my mom's 
  dream to see my success. Everything was going on good. I was enjoying my days. I was studying a little and having fun
  a little. I made numerous plans and dreamt of my upcoming new life. But I went blank on cross-checking my answers. I 
  hadn't made it through my second attemp too.</p>

<p>On my teacher's advice I had applied for two more entrances which I considered as my punishment since the beginning
  of their form fillups. And look at my badluck; I don't kow how but I had cracked them succesfully ! Very unsatisfied
  with the results that I achieved in the end, having lost my dream goal of life, and with the feeling that I destroyed 
  my career, I again trusted on KIIT to help me overcome this. With the best possible percentile I got everyone's dream 
  branch that is Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

<p>Still high on being aimless, am heading blindly towards whatever my elders and teachers are advising me to do. And my
  first year was like 8.46 CGPA; still guilty to not fulfill mom's wish of scoring as high as getting a scholarship which
  is awarded to the toppers of the branch. But with a hope in my heart that I have three more chances, I am heading towards
  a new session and with good amount of motivation to be one among the toppers of the batch ! So, GoodLuck to me.</p>
