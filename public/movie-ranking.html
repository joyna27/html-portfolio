<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time !!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sanam Teri Kasam</h3>
<p>It casts new people and just full of emotions. I was amazed by the storyline and off-course the songs are just mindblowing.</p>
<h3>KGF Part-1, Part-2, Part-3</h3>
<p>Can anyone miss a movie like KGF ? Its absolutely marvelous movie and literally talks on various topics like love for mother, life partner, job, and passion fir life.</p>
<h3>Laapata Ladies</h3>
<p>Amir Khan makes movies in good gaps and even gives us the bestest ever results. He himself wasn't present in this movie but honestly the movie is worthwhile to watch !</p>
